# Transforming Packer v1 config files to HCL2 for Packer v1.5

-> **Note:** Starting from version **1.5.0** Packer can read HCL2 files.

@include 'guides/hcl2-beta-note.mdx'

As of v1.6.4, Packer provides a tool to help you convert legacy JSON files to
HCL2 files. To run it, you can use the `hcl2_upgrade` command.

for example,

```sh
packer hcl2_upgrade mytemplate.json
```

will convert your packer template to a new HCL2 file in your current working
directory named mytemplate.json.pkr.hcl. It is not a perfect converter yet;
please open an issue if you find a problem with the conversion. Packer will not
destroy your legacy json template, so this is not a risky command to call.

Following is an explanation of how to manually upgrade a JSON template to an
HCL2 template.

The following file :

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "ami_name": "packer-test",
      "region": "us-east-1",
      "instance_type": "t2.micro",

      "source_ami_filter": {
        "filters": {
          "virtualization-type": "hvm",
          "name": "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*",
          "root-device-type": "ebs"
        },
        "owners": ["amazon"],
        "most_recent": true
      },

      "ssh_username": "ubuntu",
      "type": "amazon-ebs"
    }
  ],
  "provisioners": [
    {
      "type": "shell",
      "inline": ["sleep 5"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Becomes:

```hcl
# the source block is what was defined in the builders section and represents a
# reusable way to start a machine. You build your images from that source. All
# sources have a 1:1 correspondance to what currently is a builder. The
# argument name (ie: ami_name) must be unquoted and can be set using the equal
# sign operator (=).
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
    ami_name = "packer-test"
    region = "us-east-1"
    instance_type = "t2.micro"

    source_ami_filter {
        filters = {
          virtualization-type = "hvm"
          name =  "ubuntu/images/*ubuntu-xenial-16.04-amd64-server-*"
          root-device-type = "ebs"
        }
        owners = ["amazon"]
        most_recent = true
    }

    communicator = "ssh"
    ssh_username = "ubuntu"
}

# A build starts sources and runs provisioning steps on those sources.
build {
  sources = [
    # there can be multiple sources per build
    "source.amazon-ebs.example"
  ]

  # All provisioners and post-processors have a 1:1 correspondence to their
  # current layout. The argument name (ie: inline) must to be unquoted
  # and can be set using the equal sign operator (=).
  provisioner "shell" {
    inline = ["sleep 5"]
  }

  # post-processors work too, example: `post-processor "shell-local" {}`.
}

```

### 1:1 correspondence of components ... except :

All fields of builders, provisioners and post-processors have a 1:1
correspondance except for the following:

- builders:

  - aws ami_block_device_mappings
  - aws launch_block_device_mappings
  - aws run_volume_tags
  - alicloud image_disk_mappings
  - osc omi_block_device_mappings
  - osc launch_block_device_mappings
  - proxmox network_adapters
  - proxmox disks
  - tencentcloud data_disks
  - ucloud image_copy_to_mappings

- provisioner:

  - converge module_dirs

- post-processor:
  - alicloud-import image_disk_mappings

One could think that these are defined as "arrays of blocks" - they are in fact
repeatable blocks with the same identifier. For example:

```json
"builders": [
    {
      "type": "amazon-ebs",
      "launch_block_device_mappings": [
        {
          "device_name": "/dev/xvda",
          "volume_size": "20",
          "volume_type": "gp2",
          "delete_on_termination": "true"
        },
        {
          "device_name": "/dev/xvdf",
          "volume_size": "500",
          "volume_type": "gp2",
          "delete_on_termination": "true",
          "encrypted": true
        }
      ],
    }
]
```

Becomes:

```hcl
source "amazon-ebs" "example" {
    launch_block_device_mappings {
        device_name = "/dev/xvda"
        volume_size = 20
        volume_type = "gp2"
        delete_on_termination = true
    }
    launch_block_device_mappings {
        device_name = "/dev/xvdf"
        volume_size = 500
        volume_type = "gp2"
        delete_on_termination = true
        encrypted = true
    }
}
```

There is soon going to be a PR to drop the `s` at the end of these fields.

### Deprecation

As we become more confident in the new templates, we may begin to add new
features that are HCL2-only; one of our major motivations to moving to the new
template format is that HCL2 provides us with the flexibility to implement some
features which would be very difficult to add to the legacy JSON templates.

However, the Packer team will continue to support the main functionality of the
current "legacy JSON" packer templates alongside the new HCL2 templates until
we and the community love the new templates. Only then the v1 format will be
deprecated. We do not anticipate this happening until late 2021 at the earliest.
